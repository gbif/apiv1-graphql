# GraphQL for GBIF API v1
This project is under development

> We understand the importance of API stability and that is why we want to be clear on expectations. At this stage we cannot offer any commitment to long term (5yr), or even short term (6 month) stability. As we learn more about GraphQL we will establish a stable release. We expect this may be in 2022

## Project structure
Use node v14.15.0
Run in dev (watch) with `npm start`.
